# BarkNet
A resource for dog owners and dog walkers alike, BarkNet gives a full synopsis of every stroll a pooch takes in the Big Apple!

Overview

Dog owners can register their hounds on BarkNet to gain a deeper insight into the ambulatory habits of their furry friends. Rather than receiving clumped up wads of paper with illegible scribblings about pee and poo (or lack thereof), dog owners can track their dogs movements and habits with BarkNet’s clean and stylish interface. Dog walkers can easily enter a complete summary of the walk for the owner to see, including the route taken and pictures from the trip. Dog walkers can also plan their walks by using BarkNet’s interactive route optimizer. 

Functionality

Dog Owners

For dog owners, the first step is creating a user account. From there, users can create one or multiple profiles for their dogs, including the dog’s name, age, breed, gender, temperament, weight and profile picture. When a user’s dog is walked, the details of the walk will be uploaded by the dog walker to the dog’s profile page. 

Details of the walk include the exact route taken, the duration of the trip, and whether or not Fluffy did her business. Dogs can earn merit badges for consistent production on their strolls, while proud owners can share the exploits of their pups directly to Facebook.

Dog Walkers

For dog walkers with clients all across the city, BarkNet makes life much easier by taking away the randomness and guesswork that comes with walking a dog in an unfamiliar neighborhood. BarkNet’s mapping interface displays the perfect route for any location in the city. 

Once a user signs up and creates a profile, they are directed to the home page, which displays a map of Manhattan with a side bar containing multiple filter options. The user can plug in the starting address of their walk as well as the walk’s duration, and BarkNet will plot the best course to ensure a good time for Fido on his trip. BarkNet will search for parks and dog runs in the area, as well as pet stores, vets and even nearby fire hydrants to help make the dog’s walk more productive. 

After the walk is finished, users can upload a complete summary of the walk, including notes for the owner, the route taken, as well as pictures from the walk. Users can even pinpoint the exact locations of the dog’s deposits, allowing for trends in the dog’s habits to emerge and making the act of walking a dog more predictable. 

Never has logging a dog’s logs been this easy or fun!
